00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.140
My fellow Singaporeans, good evening.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.160
This year, we commemorate our Bicentennial,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.200
200 years of Singapore’s modern history.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.300
We began in January at the Singapore River.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.320
Since then, many community groups, businesses, schools and even individuals

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.180
have marked the Bicentennial in their own ways, and reflected on their own histories.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.420
I recently attended the Eurasian Festival.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.340
This marked 100 years of the Eurasian Association,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.380
and showcased our unique Eurasian history and culture.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.900
Earlier in April, 5 Indian dance groups held a combined performance,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.700
the Natya Yatra, at the Esplanade.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.240
They were celebrating 100 years of Indian classical dance in Singapore.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.360
There have been many events in the heartlands too.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.860
In Teck Ghee, we organised “Happily ever after – then and now”

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.680
to celebrate the diverse and changing wedding customs in Singapore.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.240
Some 90 couples, old and young, took the occasion to renew their wedding vows.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.180
It was a meaningful and joyous event.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.560
For Jalan Kayu, former residents recreated what their kampong looked like in the good old days,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.160
including the barber chair along the five-foot way.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:47.900
One of them, Uncle Ng Ah Chye, told vivid stories about life in the 1960s, almost like “李大傻讲古”.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.360
He had served in the Police Reserve Unit,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.740
and helped restore order in Geylang during the 1964 racial riots.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.180
Uncle Ng also helped to rescue residents during floods.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.560
The young people who think that floods are a very unusual thing asked him which year.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.140
Of course he could not remember because it happened many years.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.580
Uncle Ng also took part in our very first National Day Parade in 1966!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.820
For this year’s Parade, we were honoured to have the leaders of our 3 closest neighbours,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.420
Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia as our guests,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.080
and hundreds of thousands of us have visited the Bicentennial Experience at Fort Canning.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.440
The vivid re-enactments brought our rich and complex history to life,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.060
and reminded us why we are proud to be Singaporean.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.120
We had planned to close the show after the September school holidays.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500
But we have received so many requests to extend it.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.140
So we have decided to extend the Bicentennial Experience to the end of the Bicentennial year.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.980
[Applause]

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.800
I hope you will go and see it, if you have not already done so.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.120
It is well-worth it and you won't forget the experience.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.800
All these activities help us trace our long history, and appreciate the broader context

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.540
that has shaped and created modern Singapore.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.040
In our journey, we overcame many difficulties,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.180
adapted to drastic changes in our world,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.300
and blazed bold paths forward.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.400
As we look towards the future, we will need this resourcefulness and resolve more than ever.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.220
We have a full agenda.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.640
In my Malay speech earlier, I spoke about education and upgrading,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.740
and the importance of practising our faiths in open and inclusive ways

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.780
to strengthen our unity and harmony.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.180
I spoke about Islam primarily, but it applies to all faiths.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.900
In Mandarin, I spoke about external challenges,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.180
particularly what US-China tensions mean for us.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.480
I also discussed the economic situation,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.440
and how we are preparing our workers and companies to cope – short-term and long-term.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.400
These are important issues, which concern all Singaporeans.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.380
In my English speech, I want to talk about three other important things.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.040
First, enabling every young person to succeed, regardless of his or her background.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.460
Second, supporting people to work for longer, as we are living longer,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.540
and third, protecting ourselves from climate change,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.020
and renewing our city for the next century.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.300
Let me start with how we are giving our young the best possible start in life.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.500
So that anyone who works hard will have a chance to succeed,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.860
regardless of starting point or family background.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.700
Because this is what meritocracy in Singapore is about.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.360
We have made good on this promise by investing heavily in education.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.040
Our starting point used to be primary one.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.240
School brought everyone up to speed.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.560
Not just on academics, but also basic health and development.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.160
We introduced dental check-ups, as well as vaccinations.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.200
If you were underweight in primary school,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.840
you may remember the School Milk Scheme too.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.040
Generations of children have been through our schools.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.020
They received a sound education and good healthcare,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.920
and graduated better educated than their parents.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.640
Recently, Save The Children, an international NGO,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.160
ranked Singapore the best place in the world for a child to grow up in,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.220
and last year, the World Bank published a Human Capital Index.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.820
This measures the knowledge, skills, and health that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.600
Among 157 countries, Singapore ranked first.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.960
So when they launched the Index in Bali at the IMF World Bank conference,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.960
they invited me to go and be interviewed, and share our experience -

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.420
a very brief 15 minutes, not quite a National Day Rally -

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.580
how we made this journey.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.440
But the journey is not over. We are going further.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.560
We want to start earlier in a child’s life,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.340
because these years make a big difference to his development.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.020
Parents play an important role.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.660
But a good preschool education can make a crucial difference.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:29.860
That is why several years ago, we made a major shift to improve preschool education.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.360
Let me share what we have done so far, and what more we plan to do.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.060
First, we have doubled full-day preschool capacity, to almost 180,000 places.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.605
It is enough places for every child aged three and above.

00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:50.065
Young parents in newer estates, like Sengkang and Punggol, are much happier.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.220
Their MPs too, because the queues have shortened –

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.100
queues at preschools, and also queues at Meet the People sessions!

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.600
Second, we have upgraded the preschools.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.600
The new HDB void deck centres are better designed and appointed.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.840
We have built some mega centres too, with even more comprehensive facilities.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.260
Like this PCF Sparkletots centre at Punggol.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.540
It looks like a holiday resort, but the kids are expected to study quite hard there.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.480
The children have plenty of space to run around and enjoy a wider range of activities.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.240
When I visited, these kids were in their cooking studio, making pizza!

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.140
They asked me to pretend to be the teacher –

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.080
I said, I do not know how to make pizza, so please show me –

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.640
which is what they are doing.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.180
Third, we set up MOE Kindergartens.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.060
By operating kindergartens, MOE gains direct experience,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.820
improves curriculum design, and ultimately raises standards across the industry.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.140
MOE Kindergartens are also a new preschool model.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.720
Each MOE Kindergarten is located together with a primary school.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.420
Each kindergarten offers all 3 Mother Tongue Languages,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.180
and provides a bilingual environment, just like a primary school.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.760
Today, we have 24 MOE Kindergartens, and will more than double the number in the next few years.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.620
Fourth, we are giving pre-school teachers better training and career progression.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.240
We have set up the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC)

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.780
to upgrade training for preschool teachers and raise their standing.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.160
NIEC enrolled its first students this year.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.655
So these NIEC students are kindergarten teachers,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.140
or will be kindergarten teachers. Some are fresh trainees.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.540
Others are experienced teachers like Palaniammal, who is also called Sheila.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.340
Sheila started out as a preschool teacher.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.620
Over time, she upgraded herself, with a Diploma in Teaching and an Advanced Diploma in Leadership.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.680
Now, she is a Vice Principal at a PCF preschool.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.520
Sheila really enjoys working with children, and she is very good at her job.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:27.860
Last year, MOE recognised her as an Outstanding Preschool Mother Tongue Language Teacher.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:35.060
[Applause]

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.800
But Sheila aspires to do even better.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.420
Recently, she enrolled in NIEC, to specialise in Tamil Language Teaching.

00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:49.105
So with dedicated teachers like Sheila, our children are in good hands. Well done, Sheila!

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.360
Fifth, we continue to make preschool more affordable.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.725
The Government funds the Anchor Operators and Partner Operators, to keep fees down.

00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:11.220
And all parents receive significant subsidies for childcare,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.140
with lower income parents receiving substantially more.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.220
Still, for middle income parents, preschool fees can take up a chunk of their household budget.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.640
Especially if two or more kids are in preschool at the same time.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.740
Like the Low family, for example.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.020
They are middle-income. Both parents are working.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:38.720
They have two sons: Kaylen who is turning 5, and Kyler who is 2.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.300
Both boys attend a government-supported preschool.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.880
To help families like the Lows, we will enhance preschool subsidies.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.370
The Lows currently do not qualify for additional means-tested subsidies,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:59.800
because their household income exceeds the current maximum income, which is $7,500.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:13.340
We will raise the income ceiling to $12,000 per month.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:27.280
This will extend the means-tested subsidies to 30,000 more households, including the Lows.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:37.280
On top of this, we will also increase the quantum of preschool subsidies, across the board.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:46.700
Before the changes, Mr and Mrs Low pay about $560 per month for each child’s preschool.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.015
The enhanced subsidy will knock off a third of their preschool expenses,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.900
which will then go down to around $370 per child.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:04.420
Later on, when Kaylen and Kyler enter primary school, the family’s expenses will go down even further.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.700
Because primary school itself is almost free –

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.700
you have to pay a few dollars miscellaneous fees.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.640
If the boys need student care after school in the afternoons,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.980
it will cost the Lows about $300 per child.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:31.040
So it is even lower than the $370 that they will be paying after the enhanced subsidies.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.300
In the medium term, we aim to bring down full-day preschool expenses to around that level –

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.540
which means the cost of primary school plus after school student care is $370

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.920
coming down to around $300.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.200
We need a while to get there, but we are working towards this.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.180
Recently several PAP women Members of Parliament (MPs), led by SPS Sun Xueling,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.140
surveyed young parents on preschool.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.180
Understandably, the parents were concerned about affordability.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.460
The MPs made an important point:

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.080
that preschool should be like housing and healthcare,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.980
where we have a good and affordable government-funded option for all Singaporeans.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.020
There is a private option if you want,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.520
but for many Singaporeans, in fact, the majority,

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:27.900
the government-funded option is high quality and more than satisfactory.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.280
I agree with them.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.440
For housing we have HDB.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.660
For healthcare, we have restructured hospitals.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:46.220
Similarly, for preschool, we should have good quality, government-supported choices available to all Singaporeans.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.380
This is in fact our policy.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.040
Today, just over half of all pre-school places are government-supported.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.340
Over time, we will bring this up to 80%, just like HDB

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.620
and we are putting a lot of resources towards this.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.740
Already, the Government spends about $1 billion a year on early childhood education,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.000
and this will more than double over the next few years.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.260
Hopefully with all these improvements,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:21.500
parents will no longer think of preschools as an expensive phase of bringing up their children.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.080
The younger ministers have a few more ideas to support couples to have more kids,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.640
and to keep HDB flats affordable.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:36.120
I will leave them to make the announcements later.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:45.980
Meanwhile I will be counting the number of babies born, and hoping for the number to go up!

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.360
I want to update you on one more programme, and that is KidSTART.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.860
We piloted KidSTART 3 years ago,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.600
to give extra help to 1,000 children from less privileged families.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.500
The KidSTART team advises and supports the parents,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:13.560
often a single parent – on nutrition, child development, and parent-child interaction.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.420
We are very happy with the results, and so are the parents.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.160
Let’s take a look at the video.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.760
KidSTART is a good programme.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.000
I am confident we are on the right track.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.440
We still need to follow up for a few more years, to assess more exactly its benefits.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.700
But for each new cohort of babies, there is no time to lose.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:19.960
So we will expand KidSTART to reach another 5,000 children over the next 3 years.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.860
Then we will take stock again how to expand KidSTART further.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.940
The commitment to do our best for every child is deeply embedded in our education system.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:38.820
That is why we heavily subsidise school fees from preschool to university, polytechnic and ITE.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.920
So that every child can afford a good education.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:49.400
I recently received a letter from an NUS law student, Quek Lu Yi.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.800
Lu Yi wrote about how she felt a sense of inferiority when she was growing up,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.600
because many of her classmates came from better-off families.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.240
Let me read from her letter.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.160
She said as she grew older, she realised that

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.860
“this was an extremely misplaced sense of shame.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.360
My parents had done nothing wrong.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.080
They’d supported me throughout my life

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.980
and gave me the best they could.”

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.100
A few years before Lu Yi entered NUS, her family ran into difficulty.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.360
Lu Yi worried about becoming a burden on her family.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.120
She already had one sibling in university

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.140
and another about to start.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.900
And even after she started her law course,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.780
financial concerns were frequently on her mind –

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.220
buying books, a laptop, school trips and other activities.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.295
But she applied for and received a bursary,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.480
which significantly eased her financial worries.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:58.260
MOE has done a comprehensive review of tertiary fees and bursaries.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.180
First, MOE looked at whether our universities can operate more economically.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.320
2 of them, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.760
and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), are more applied,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.740
and do more industry attachments and internships.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.760
Their operating costs per student can be lower,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.340
especially as student intakes grow.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:32.660
So MOE will lower the annual fees for the full-time general degree programmes in SIT and SUSS,

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:40.320
from around $8,000 now, to $7,500.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.560
Second, MOE will significantly enhance government bursaries.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.940
For university courses, we will increase government bursaries

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:58.080
from up to 50%of general degree fees today, to up to 75%.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.820
For a general degree programme in NUS, like Economics or Computer Science,

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.500
full fees are about $8,000 a year.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:14.400
Currently, a lower income student would pay around half that, $4,000 a year,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.940
if he uses his bursary fully to his fees.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:33.320
With the enhanced bursary, he would pay only $2,000 per year.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.880
Similarly, for polytechnic diploma programmes,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:44.640
we will increase the bursary coverage from up to 80% of the fees today, to up to 95%

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.700
For polytechnic diploma, full fees are now $3,000.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:58.260
With a bursary, a lower income poly student currently pays about $600 a year.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:04.620
After we enhance the bursary, he will pay only $150.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.895
I have given examples of lower income students.

00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:22.020
Actually, 6 in 10 students in our polytechnics and universities are eligible for government bursaries.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:27.420
So these enhancements will benefit many middle income students too.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.320
Students in Government-funded diploma and degree programmes

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:36.180
at ITE, NAFA, and LASALLE will also be covered.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.360
I want to say something about one particular university course, and that is Medicine.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.020
It is very expensive to train a medical student.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.580
Hence, Medicine has the highest course fees of all the university courses.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:58.240
Today, after Government subsidies, medical school fees are almost $29,000 a year at NUS,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.920
and $35,000 a year at NTU.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.620
These are not small amounts.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:11.860
We should not let the cost of medical school deter good students from studying medicine.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:18.720
In fact, we want doctors to have diverse educational and family backgrounds.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.560
On the education front, recent medical school intakes have included more polytechnic graduates,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:36.800
and this year, we had one ITE graduate for the first time, in NUS medical school.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:43.620
But on the socio-economic front, we should do more to encourage lower income students to do medicine.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.860
Therefore, we will enhance government bursaries for medical school,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.620
to make them significantly more generous than bursaries for other courses.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.840
If you add together the government bursaries for medicine,

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.900
plus other bursaries from the university

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:15.800
then lower income students will now pay at most $5,000 per year to study Medicine.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.660
This balance can then be covered by student loans with much less difficulty.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.140
So, if you are a student and you are worried about your finances

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.560
but you have an ambition to be a doctor,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.760
I say do not worry about the money.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.540
That will be taken care of. Go for it.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.540
All these fee and bursary adjustments I have talked about,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.057
for both medical and non-medical courses,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:46.940
will apply to both existing and new students, from the next academic year.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.680
[Applause]

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.300
The point of these changes to fees and bursaries is not just the dollars and cents.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.180
We are determined to make our education system as accessible as possible.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.875
We want every Singaporean son and daughter to have the opportunity to receive a good education,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.360
and start well in life, regardless of family circumstances.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.540
Students from less privileged backgrounds must be confident that they will get financial help,

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.140
if they need it to see them through their education.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.020
They should neither feel disadvantaged nor inferior

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.400
comparing themselves to better off classmates,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.840
nor should they be deterred from pursuing a course just because of money.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.700
This is fundamental to maintaining Singapore as an open meritocracy.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.080
Apart from government bursaries,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.020
our universities, polytechnics and ITE also raise funds to create their own bursaries.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.400
These bursaries often have names associated with them,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:01.500
like the EW Barker Bursary in NUS, named after our founding Law Minister,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.360
or the Class of 1995 Term Bursary in NTU.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.120
The Class of 1995, that means the class which graduated in 1995,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.280
must have come together and raised some money,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.920
endowed a bursary, to remind the next generation

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.160
that when it comes to your turn to, go thou and do likewise.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.260
This personalises the bursary award.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.365
The recipient is grateful to the donor,

00:26:31.365 --> 00:26:34.260
the donor is happy to have done a good deed,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:39.580
and both donor and recipient honour the person after whom the bursary is named.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:47.240
And in time, hopefully the recipient will make good, remember, and be moved to pay it forward.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.080
Lu Yi, the NUS student who wrote to me, received such a bursary.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.860
Hers was a Kwa Geok Choo Bursary,

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.680
which the NUS Law School had established in my mother’s name.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.900
She wrote to me, I think, because I was one of those who contributed to the bursary fund.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.180
She wrote in her letter:

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.780
“Thank you for opening my eyes to the compassion and generosity of our society,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.980
for being the helping hand and for setting my mind at ease.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.160
This is a kindness that will stay with me through my life

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.820
and I hope to be able to do my part and help others in similar positions in the future”.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.080
Thank you, Lu Yi!

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:34.800
[Applause]

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.800
We wish you all the best for your studies.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:46.000
We try very hard to kindle the same warm personal feeling with Government bursaries,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:55.400
but alas, it is not so easy to write a letter like that to say “Dear Government, thank you very much”.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.360
So to complement the Government bursaries,

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:06.000
I hope the universities, polytechnics and ITE will set up more bursaries of their own, in people’s names.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.360
And I hope the alumni and community will contribute generously too.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.120
The Government will match your donations, up to 3 times for the newer universities,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.020
and up to 1.5 times for the rest.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:28.100
Our institutions often raise funds for new buildings and professorships, and this is always meritorious.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.360
But bursaries can make a crucial difference to the recipients – and they have the extra human touch.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.420
If you donate towards a bursary, you enable some promising young person to get a good start in life.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.840
This strengthens our sense of obligation to each other,

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.060
and the bonds that link us all together as one society.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.760
Our education system gives young Singaporeans a headstart when they enter the job market.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.460
But our support does not end there.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:12.080
As people progress in their careers, SkillsFuture will help to keep their knowledge and skills up to date.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:18.120
We need to do this, because jobs and skills are turning over faster than ever.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.860
We also need to keep on re-skilling ourselves for another reason.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:30.780
Singaporeans are living longer, and mostly also want to work longer.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:39.040
So, my next topic is about helping Singaporeans work longer, if they wish to do so.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.660
Our life expectancy at birth

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.980
– the latest figures which came out just a few weeks ago –

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.800
is now nearly 85 years.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.280
It's the longest in the world.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.620
Now, even longer than Japan!

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.820
[Applause]

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.480
This means about half of us can expect to live longer than 85 years.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.280
We all know many people who are older than 85.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.740
Quite a few turned up for my National Day Observance Ceremony in Teck Ghee,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.520
including this sprightly lady, Mdm Liang Juat Eng.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.100
She is 102.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.220
[Applause]

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.460
In the Rally in 2007, when I talked about ageing,

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:40.780
I checked out the numbers and reported that we then had 500 centenarians – people aged 100 and over.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.140
This year, for my speech, I said please update the number,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.440
and in just over a decade, the number has more than doubled

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:59.600
– we now have 1,300 centenarians, including Mdm Liang!

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.160
That means every MP has about 14 of them – should look them up.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.160
I hope some of them are watching my speech on TV.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.500
The good news is that Singaporeans stay healthy for longer too, protected by MediShield Life.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.640
Most seniors in fact do not want to stop working.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.760
We are healthy for longer and living longer,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.160
but we do not want to spend more years idle in retirement.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.620
We want to stay active and engaged, to feel a sense of worth and purpose.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:37.000
Zumba, and more things.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.600
Also many of us want to build up a bigger nest egg for when we eventually retire.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.120
Therefore, many of us have multiple careers in a lifetime.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.520
Enabling seniors to continue working productively takes a joint effort.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.160
Employers must redesign their training, jobs, and careers

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.040
around the abilities and strengths of the older workers.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.100
The older workers may not be as strong or quick as their younger colleagues,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.900
but this is actually not a problem in many jobs,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.180
where we can redesign the job, or we can use technology.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:23.060
This way, employers can continue to tap on the skills, knowledge and experience of our older workers.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.300
Employees, on their part, must adopt the right mindset.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:35.160
We must be ready to adapt, learn new things, and take on different responsibilities.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.515
We cannot just be satisfied doing our old jobs well, because many jobs will change.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.760
And some jobs will disappear –

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:50.200
shorthand typists and telephone switchboard operators do not exist anymore.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.740
Re-skilling ourselves must start early,

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.920
even when we are in our 40s and 50s, if not even earlier.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.220
But 40s, and 50s, you are not quite so young any more, but not yet old.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.480
And you have to pay attention.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.120
Because if you do it then, then you will have useful skills which will be valuable.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:19.180
We hope as you near retirement age, and you can keep improving even in our 60s.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:25.000
And of course, Government will fully support both employers and employees in this endeavour.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.080
I visited Workforce Singapore’s Careers Connect centre in January.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.820
There, I met Nahariah Mohd Nor.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:38.360
She used to be a bank teller.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.480
Nahariah is the one in the red tudung.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.880
Nowadays banks need fewer tellers because of online banking,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:53.240
ATMs, and now VTMs, or video teller machines, which are more advanced than ATMs.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:59.940
Nahariah took up an offer by her employer to retrain as a Customer Service Officer for VTMs.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.260
She does not stand around at the VTMs;

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:08.680
she is sitting at a console in an ops room, monitoring multiple VTMs.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.920
When customers have problems with the VTM,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.920
they press the Help button on the machine.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.000
And Nahariah’s face pops up on the screen,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.440
and she advises customers what to do.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.620
She told me, usually the first question she is asked is:

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.300
“Are you real or are you AI?”

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.820
So she smiles and goes: “No, no, I’m real!”

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:36.120
The customers may be a bit doubtful at first, because the AI can be very good,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.280
but very soon they can tell she has the human touch.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.900
As a result, Nahariah is doing a new job,

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.380
serves more customers than she used to,

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.160
and can be productive and employable for many more years.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:54.700
Well done, Nahariah!

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.560
[Applause]

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:05.620
I should also commend Nahariah’s employer, DBS.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.720
DBS has made great efforts to modernise itself, and to adopt technology.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.840
In the past one year, it was named the best bank in the world by 3 major industry publications.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.420
Most importantly, DBS has been working very hard to retrain its employees.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:27.820
It has shown care and concern for its people, even as it transforms itself.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.760
In fact, if they did not share care and concern for its people,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.380
it is unlikely to have become the best bank in the world.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:40.600
So DBS has the right approach, and I encourage other companies to emulate DBS’ example.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.900
Good job Lah, DBS!

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:51.260
[Applause]

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.400
It is not just big companies that can retrain and upgrade workers.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.180
So can SMEs.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.140
This is Chan Ban Kiong.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.220
He is 64 – much older than Nahariah!

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.200
Ban Kiong has been in the marine industry for over 30 years.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.640
He works for Mencast Marine, which makes and repairs ship propellers.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.020
He used to make the ship propellers by hand.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.560
First, he crafts a mould out of sand, to create a prototype propeller.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.000
He uses this aluminium prototype to make a second mould.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:31.440
Finally, he casts the bronze propeller itself.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.060
It is hard work, and requires experience and skill.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:44.040
Mencast decided to increase productivity by using 3D printers to manufacture the propeller prototypes.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.840
But they still valued the experienced eye of their older workers, to ensure the quality of the work.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.120
So they are training Ban Kiong and eight colleagues to operate the 3D printers

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.960
– and all of them are over 60!

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.660
Now, their work will become safer and easier, and the production time will be faster by a third.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:10.580
So it is win-win-win, for the workers, company and customers too,

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.640
and that is the way it should be. Well done, Mencast and Ban Kiong!

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.840
[Applause]

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:26.535
I hope more companies will likewise help their older workers remain employable well into their 60s.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.880
The Government will do its best to support older workers and the businesses that employ them.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.680
Last year, the Ministry of Manpower, MOM,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.120
set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers to study the issue.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.200
I met the Workgroup members last month for lunch.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.540
They told me they had had intense discussions.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.940
Even at lunch, the discussions were quite intense.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:58.820
Why? Older workers wanted to be certain of continued employment for longer.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.620
When can I retire later? Can I be reemployed longer?

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.640
Can I be reemployed more years at a time?

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.000
But employers were worried about business costs

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.140
and the uncertain economic outlook, and they said

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:18.540
“I support you, I understand your aspirations, but I need more flexibility.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.380
Because I don't know what will happen.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.560
If I go broke, your job's gone too.”

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.020
In the end the Workgroup reached consensus.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.220
They made  key recommendations.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:38.880
First, to raise the Retirement Age from 62 today to 65.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:46.680
Second, to raise the Re-employment Age from 67 today to 70.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.780
Third, to increase CPF contributions for older workers.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:39:01.760
And fourth, to achieve all this in gradual steps, by about 2030.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.180
I think these are sensible recommendations.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:10.220
The Government accepts them in full.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:23.540
Let me explain them in a little more,  and I will start with CPF for older workers, which is a bit  more complicated.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:29.900
Today, CPF contribution rates for workers begin to taper down after the workers turn 55.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.200
So you see the age of the workers, and the different contribution rates.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.300
Up to 55, you pay the full rate.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.480
Beyond 55, it comes steps down.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:49.380
Beyond 60, it's steps down again, and it continues on as long as you're working.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.780
We will raise the rates for workers above 55.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.540
We will take the first step in 2021.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:06.000
So you'll see the rates go up for these groups of workers, and we will take subsequent steps after that.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.100
And the whole process will take 10 years or so, about there, but it depends on economic conditions.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:21.020
And by the time we are done, those who are 60 and below will all get the full rates,

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.720
and all pay the full rates, and then the step down will only start here.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.900
So you pay the full rates all the way up to when you are 60,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.216
and then the rates come down, come down at 65,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.920
come down again at 70,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.500
and at 70, they level off.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:48.640
So this is the first change – to increase CPF for older workers gradually over the next 10 years or so.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:55.340
Next, in 2022, we will start to raise both the Retirement Age a year after we raise the CPF the first time,

00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:02.780
we will start to raise both the retirement age and re-employment age for all employers.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:11.580
The Retirement Age will go from 62 – which is what it is today – to 63 in 2022,

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.500
and eventually to 65 by 2030.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:27.060
The Re-employment Age will go from 67 – which is where it is now – to 68, also in 2022,

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.420
and eventually to 70, by 2030.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:37.080
And therefore, by 2030, we should reach our 1st and 2nd objectives,

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.240
which means Retirement Age goes to 65,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.540
and the Re-employment Age goes to 70.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.640
The Government will help businesses to adjust to these new arrangements.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.320
We will implement a support package for them and

00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.500
DPM Heng Swee Keat will announce it in next year’s Budget.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:06.540
As a major employer ourselves, the Government will take the lead for public officers.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:16.660
The Public Service will raise its Retirement and Re-employment Ages one year early, 2021 instead of 2022.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:24.000
I encourage private sector companies which can do the same, also to do so.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.500
All these changes – to the Retirement Age, the Re-employment Age, and the CPF rates –

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.720
will support older workers to continue working longer

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.760
and to be more financially independent.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.360
Let me add one last point here, to be absolutely clear:

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:54.100
We are not making any changes to CPF withdrawal policies or CPF withdrawal ages.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.400
Let me say that once again in case you didn't take it down:

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:12.660
We are not making any changes to CPF withdrawal policies or to CPF withdrawal ages.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.440
You can still take out some money at age 55.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.180
And you can still start your CPF payouts from age 65.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.860
All this remains exactly the same.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:35.840
and if you hear anybody telling you something different, please ignore him or her.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:42.160
And if it comes to you on WhatsApp from a friend , please delete it and tell your friend.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:49.220
Don't share it with more friends and confuse people because that will be fake news.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:59.140
POFMA will catch you!

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.380
Next, let me talk about renewing our city and our home for the next century.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.140
I will start with climate change.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.120
Climate change may seem abstract and distant for many of us.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.500
But it is one of the gravest challenges facing humankind.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:21.280
Our young people instinctively appreciate the seriousness of the issue.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:27.060
When the National Youth Council recently asked young people what their vision was for Singapore’s future,

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.100
many spoke about the environment.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.940
Let’s hear from them.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.740
What is climate change?

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.240
What is it about? Why should we be concerned?

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:09.680
Let me try to explain a huge and complicated subject simply and briefly.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:16.300
Human activity is pumping more and more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:21.380
We produce CO2 when we drive a car or take a plane.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.280
Or run a manufacturing plant.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.160
Or use electrical appliances at home,

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:34.020
because nearly all our electricity is generated from natural gas, which is a fossil fuel.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.260
The CO2 builds up in the atmosphere,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.540
traps heat from the sun,

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.280
and causes the planet to warm up.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:49.920
Already, the Earth’s average temperature has gone up by 1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.960
over a 100 years ago.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.160
One degree Celsius doesn't sound like much, but it is very significant.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.100
Furthermore, temperatures are continuing to rise, faster and faster.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:08.420
Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting into the oceans,

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.780
and this is raising sea levels around the world.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:18.280
The UN currently projects that sea levels will rise by up to one metre by the end of this century,

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:24.700
one metre, about three feet, it's just 80 years from now.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.900
But the scientists’ estimates have been going up.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:34.340
So sea levels may quite possibly rise higher and faster than that.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.880
Global warming is also making the weather more extreme.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.440
Droughts are getting more severe and prolonged.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.080
Rainfall and storms are becoming more intense.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.220
Singapore is already feeling the impact.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.760
Our weather is palpably hotter. Rainstorms are heavier.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:47:00.600
And this will very likely worsen over the next few decades, within the lifetimes of many of us.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.140
A recent Swiss study found that by 2050,

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:08.960
just 30 years from now, several cities in the world will experience unprecedented climate shifts.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:14.240
And it found that one of them will be Singapore.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.240
We must prepare for the impact of climate change on Singapore.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.540
There are many risks and consequences.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.360
New diseases, more frequent pandemics,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:33.160
food shortages, forced migration of displaced populations, even wars.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.300
And because we are a low-lying island,

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:43.000
Singapore is especially vulnerable to one grave threat, and that is rising sea levels.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.100
In the 1960s and 70s, floods were common in Singapore, especially during the rainy season.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:54.100
That's why Uncle Ng Ah Chye from Jalan Kayu, whom I told you about earlier,

00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:00.000
had to rescue so many stranded residents whenever it flooded.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:06.960
When we had high tides, monsoon drains in low-lying parts of Singapore would fill up almost to the brim,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.100
even if it wasn't raining.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.720
And if it did rain, it would flood.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.760
Gan Kim Yong told me when he was a child,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:21.420
his family lived in Hong Kong Street in Chinatown, where his father ran a shop.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.080
Hong Kong Street is next to this one.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:28.640
This one is Temple Street, but it looked like this also.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.460
When there was an exceptionally high tide, which happened a few times a year,

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:40.440
the tide water would rise up from the drains onto the five-foot way in front of the shop,

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:45.740
even without rain.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:51.680
And so his father had to build racks to stack up his goods, out of reach of the water.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.320
To Kim Yong, who was then a boy, this was great fun.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.880
I don't think that is Gan Kim Yong.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.320
But actually it was a serious matter.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.060
These old flooding problems are now largely resolved.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.440
We improved the drainage system.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.460
We required buildings to be built on higher platforms,

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:22.060
at least 3 metres above the mean sea level.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:29.460
3 metres sounds a lot because a person, most of us are less than 2 metres tall.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.940
But 3 meters isn't actually that high,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:37.640
because at high tide, the water can go up 2 meters above the mean sea level.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:44.160
And that leaves only 1 metre buffer to cope with other factors.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.760
For example, heavy rain.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.020
So if it rains, it fills up a little bit, and you are still okay

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:55.120
and the water has some where to go.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.640
So because of this 1 metre buffer, we've managed to deal with our flooding problems thus far.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:07.600
But, with global warming, if sea levels rise by 1 metre, our buffer is gone.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.960
Because when it's high tide, 2 metres above that,

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.980
you're already, water reaching the five-foot way.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.280
We'll have no more buffer.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:27.380
And if heavy rain coincides with a high tide, the water will have nowhere to go.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:33.220
And we will, literally, be in deep water!

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.580
Like Bangladesh whenever they are hit by a cyclone.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.000
Or, to take an extreme example, like New Orleans,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.800
much of which is below sea level –

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:55.600
here you can see how the city was completely flooded when Hurricane Katrina hit it in 2005.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.040
So what can we do? Three things:

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.920
understand climate change, mitigate climate change, and adapt to climate change.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.280
And let me explain them one by one.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:16.440
First of all, we have to understand what climate change means specifically for Singapore.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:28.880
Is it hot weather, extreme weather, drought, intense rain, water levels, sea levels, and therefore what do we do.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.160
So we have set up a Centre for Climate Research Singapore, CCRS.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.580
I visited them earlier this year.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.580
They have a team of scientists and meteorologists,

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.720
and supercomputers to model the weather and do research.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.980
They showed me the records they have, which go back more than a century.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:51.000
Including these old weather diaries – which I am looking at.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:01.060
They go back to the 1930s, which were meticulously kept at the weather station on Mount Faber.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:07.560
CCRS is cooperating with their counterparts in neighbouring countries to study in more detail

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.660
how climate change is affecting Southeast Asia.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:16.140
They are finding that Singapore, being near the equator, is more vulnerable to climate change

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.000
than the global model suggests.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.760
Second, we must mitigate climate change.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.760
What does mitigate mean?

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:31.080
It means we must do our part to reduce CO2 emissions.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:36.020
Singapore has joined international efforts to reduce emissions.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.080
We are part of the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:46.120
and we have committed to slow down and ultimately cap our CO2 emissions by around 2030.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:51.740
To help achieve this, last year we introduced a carbon tax.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:56.320
Each of us can do our bit to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.180
Like remembering to switch off the lights, reducing waste, and reusing and recycling more.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.860
In Singapore, we generate a huge amount of waste –

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.200
whether from excessive packaging, food waste, or electronic waste.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:17.860
These all have to be disposed of, and often incinerated, which then generates more CO2.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.120
Our landfill is at Pulau Semakau.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:30.680
But eventually that will fill up, and then we will need Bukit Semakau, and then Gunung Semakau!

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.660
So we have to find a sustainable solution.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:38.700
This is where young Singaporeans have been doing their part.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:44.120
Like Farah Sanwari, who is passionate about sustainability.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.040
Farah co-founded Repair Kopitiam a few years ago,

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:54.380
to teach others how to repair damaged electronic appliances, furniture, toys and clothing.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.100
So that these items can gain a new lease of life and you can use them longer,

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.800
instead of throwing them away prematurely.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.860
I think we need more young Singaporeans to be like Farah, to be problem-solvers,

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.100
innovators, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs.

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.660
[Applause]

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.680
As the song suggests, be prepared to do our part.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:23.480
This is the Grand Challenge for their generation.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.640
Although Singapore may not be able to stop climate change by ourselves,

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.460
we can contribute to solutions, and we must do our fair share.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:36.040
Then we can be credible asking others to reduce their emissions too,

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.000
and work towards a global solution to climate change.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.480
But unfortunately, such a global solution is still very far off.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.940
So we must work for the best, but be prepared for the worst.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:59.680
Therefore, the third thing we must do, is adapt to climate change, and especially rising sea levels.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.960
We will need local measures to protect individual buildings and developments –

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.800
and we have been doing this.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.200
For example, we have built MRT stations with elevated entrances.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:17.000
When you enter an MRT station, you need to climb up a few steps before you go down the escalator.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.240
This is flood protection for our MRT system.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:27.600
If we need to raise the steps higher, well we will do that one day.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.960
We also require new developments to be built on higher platforms,

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.980
instead of building 3 metres above mean sea level like before,

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.420
they must now be at least 4metres above mean sea level.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.780
For critical infrastructure like Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Port,

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:51.640
we are raising the platforms even higher, at least 5 metres above mean sea level.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.500
But local measures will not be enough.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.340
We have many older buildings.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:01.180
These cannot be lifted up, or transported to higher ground.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:08.940
In fact, large parts of Singapore are low-lying, and we need to protect these low-lying areas as a whole.

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.120
Let me show you the topography of Singapore.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.040
This is a map of Singapore. The light green are the lowest parts.

00:56:18.205 --> 00:56:20.995
The dark green is a little bit higher.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.820
The beige are the hills, and the dark brown are our “mountains”!

00:56:28.615 --> 00:56:31.775
Well, there are not very many dark brown pieces,

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:38.200
so I don't think we can all retreat to live on Bukit Timah!

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.400
Now let me show you the lowest parts,

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.760
those which are up to 4 metres above mean sea level.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.040
That's where all the blue stuff comes in.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:54.880
You see, the island looks much smaller if those one day... become at risk.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:01.760
When sea levels rise, all these parts will increasingly be at risk.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.500
Not underwater yet, but at risk,

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:11.340
like Chinatown used to be in the old days – high tide, rain, troubled.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:17.020
And, if you look carefully, there is a long stretch along the East Coast to the city.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:21.460
If you zoom in a little bit,

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.240
you might be able to see where your house is.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:31.600
Not only will property values be affected, but safety and liveability also.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:37.860
And it won't just be the houses in the pink area in trouble, but the whole city.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.520
Because roads and trains run through the low-lying areas;

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.560
hospitals, schools, and workplaces, all there.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.060
We can't lose a big chunk of our city and expect the rest of Singapore to carry on as usual.

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:57.620
Therefore, beyond localised measures, we need to protect entire areas,

00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:04.060
and the way to do that is to build coastal defences.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:09.620
We have studied our whole coastline in detail, and we have divided it into different segments.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.980
Some are more vulnerable than others,

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:15.900
and we need different strategies to protect each of them,

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.040
and we will have to prioritise the work,

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.160
starting with the more critical segments,

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:28.020
and in particular, City-East Coast and also Jurong Island.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.980
I will talk about the City – East Coast, which is a long stretch

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:39.300
comprising the city area, and the eastern coastline.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.740
Let’s look at the city area first.

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:52.040
We built the Marina Reservoir and Marina Barrage, to protect the city area from flooding.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.840
Many of us enjoy visiting the Marina Barrage,

00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:01.500
to picnic and fly kites on top of the Pump House, especially if we have little kids.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:08.300
But PUB did not build the Pump House for kite flying!

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.740
Its real purpose is to house 7 giant pumps.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:16.400
That is why it is so tall.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:23.440
When it rains heavily during high tide, these pumps pump water out of Marina Reservoir into the sea,

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:29.900
so that rain falling in the city area can then drain into Marina Reservoir.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.920
When sea levels rise, one Pump House will not be enough.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:39.060
We will need to build a second Pump House, on the opposite end of the Barrage.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.340
PUB has planned for this.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.680
So that’s for the city.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:48.880
For the eastern coastline, we will need possibly other solutions.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.340
We have looked at other countries for inspiration.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.640
In particular, we studied the Netherlands.

00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:59.520
The word “Netherlands” itself means “low-lying lands”.

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.135
"Nether" - 'low-lying' - "Lands."

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.520
Half of the Netherlands is at most 1 metre above sea level.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.660
In fact, one quarter (27%) of their land is actually below sea level,

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.640
what the Dutch call “polders”.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:24.320
A polder is land –&nbsp;this is one of them – that the Dutch have reclaimed from the sea.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.520
They first build a seawall in the water, enclose an area.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.220
Then they pump out the water behind the seawall, and you create dry land,

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.160
and that dry land can be lower than sea level –

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:44.180
and then you have to keep on pumping water out.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.460
The Dutch are famous for their windmills.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.880
But do you know why the Dutch originally built windmills?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.620
It was not to take tourist pictures.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.220
It was to pump water out of the polders and keep the land dry.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't think windmills will do very well in Singapore.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:13.260
The only windmill we had in Singapore was at Holland Village...

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.220
and even that one is gone now.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.980
But, polders are a serious option for us.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.820
We are building a small polder at Pulau Tekong, to gain some experience operating one.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.040
This is on the North-West part of Pulau Tekong,

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.695
if you come in from the North to land at Changi, you can see it.

01:01:32.695 --> 01:01:35.225
You can see we're building the seawall here,

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:41.520
enclose the sea, and we will level off the land behind that,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.160
and  pump out the water, and this will be a polder.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.160
And we will use the new land for SAF training.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:55.000
Polders are one option to protect our eastern coastline.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.980
Because instead of just building a seawall along the coastline,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.420
you extend out with a polder, build a seawall further out,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.920
you not only protect existing low-lying pink areas,

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.600
But you extend out and create more land, reclaimed from the sea

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.920
which we can use for housing and other valuable purposes.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.240
That is one possible solution for the East Coast,

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.100
to build polders along the coastline.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.200
But there are other alternatives.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:33.320
For example, we could reclaim a series of islands offshore, from Marina East all the way to Changi.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.300
Then we join up the islands, connect them up with barrages,

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:43.200
and create a freshwater reservoir, behind them,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.240
like that, which will be similar to Marina Reservoir.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.260
This solution will make PUB very happy because we will have another big reservoir,

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.440
and it will enhance our water resilience.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.880
Our "four taps" will become more reliable.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.780
What I showed you are just artists’ impressions,

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:08.080
I prepared them for this speech to give you a sense of the possibilities

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.160
We have not done engineering drawings yet.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.340
We will examine all the options carefully,

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.020
and when the time comes, we will decide what is the best way to do it.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:27.420
This problem does have good engineering solutions, although they will all cost money.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.880
How much will it cost, to protect ourselves against rising sea levels?

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:41.220
My guess is probably $100 billion over 100 years, quite possibly more.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:47.160
If we only have 10 years to solve the problem, we won't have the time or the resources to do it.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.240
But because this is a 50 to 100-year problem,

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.745
we can implement a 50 to 100-year solution to this problem.

01:03:56.235 --> 01:04:02.005
In Singapore, for long-term problems, we can make long-term solutions.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:07.560
Not everywhere, but in Singapore, yes, we can.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:16.700
[Applause]

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:26.740
We should treat climate change defences like we treat the SAF – with utmost seriousness.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.380
Work steadily at it, maintain a stable budget year after year,

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:40.360
keep your eye on the target, and do it over many years and several generations.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.480
That way we can afford it, and when we need it, we will have it ready.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.040
Both the SAF and climate change defences are existential for Singapore.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.060
These are life and death matters.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:05:01.320
Everything else must bend at the knee to safeguard the existence of our island nation.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.040
There is one difference between the two.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.540
With the SAF, we hope never to go to war.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:15.680
If you have a strong SAF, you may deter threats and avoid having to go to war.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.880
But with climate change, we know for sure sea levels will rise.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:28.800
And the only uncertainty is whether they rise a few decades earlier, or a few decades later.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.560
Therefore, we will implement our climate change plans progressively and keep them flexible.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.400
But we must start now and sustain the effort,

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.060
as the Dutch have done over the centuries,

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.140
and as we have done with the SAF.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.840
We must make this effort.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:06:01.200
Otherwise one day, our children and grandchildren will be ashamed of what our generation did not do.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.760
Beyond protecting ourselves from rising seas,

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.400
We also have long-term plans to remake and take full advantage of our coastline.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.820
One of these plans is the Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW).

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:16.640
I first spoke about this in the 2013 Rally.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.420
Since then we have worked out more definite ideas.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.260
Let me first sketch out the overall shape.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:29.240
The GSW comprises 30km of our southern coastline,

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.040
from the Gardens by the Bay East, all the way to Pasir Panjang,

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.140
and is about 2,000 hectares of land:

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:45.960
it is 6 times the size of Marina Bay or in other terms, about two Punggols.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:53.720
The GSW includes the PSA city terminals, which are at Tanjong Pagar, at Brani, and at Keppel.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.900
And they also include the Pasir Panjang Terminals.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:07.500
By 2027, the city terminals will move to Tuas, where we're building a new port.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:15.520
And later on, in 2040, the Pasir Panjang Terminal will also go to Tuas Port.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.260
This will free up prime land for re-development.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:27.120
It will be an opportunity to reshape the Greater Southern Waterfront into a new place to live, work and play.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.360
And let me start with "live".

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.720
Here is Keppel golf course, Keppel Club.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:46.780
It is close to 2 MRT stations, you can see them, and Labrador Park, down here, the Nature Reserve.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.640
The lease is expiring in two years’ time,

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.660
so this will be one of the first Greater Southern Waterfront developments.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.700
There is enough land here to build 9,000 housing units –

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:03.300
not quite so fast, but 9,000 housing units.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:10.720
HDB and private housing with waterfront promenades, with greenery, and open spaces.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.680
And that is just the start, because there is space and land

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.380
for public and private housing elsewhere in the  Greater Southern Waterfront too.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:26.580
With GSW the size of 2 Punggols, you get a sense of the possibilities.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:34.340
Think of it as Punggol by the Bay

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:39.080
Next, I go on to "work” – the commercial areas.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.240
Several big companies already have offices near Labrador Park.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.160
Such as Google, Cisco and Unilever.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.460
We will develop more office space in the GSW,

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:59.340
like this one, which is Mapletree Business Park, which will bring in more jobs.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.060
People can work near where they live, and live near where they work.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:06.680
This will create life and activity, both during the day and at night.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:13.280
I take it this is at night.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.780
Finally, I come to “play” –&nbsp;actually, I got there already – the fun part.

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.015
There are many possibilities for fun and recreation.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.960
We will start by redeveloping the two old power stations in Pasir Panjang.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.420
These are the Pasir Panjang power stations.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:34.420
They used to supply electricity back in the 1960s, but were decommissioned long ago.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.980
We can find creative new uses for them.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:45.300
Just like the way we made St James Power Station, near Vivo City, into a nightlife destination.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:54.820
Next, after Brani Terminal moves out, we can develop Pulau Brani together with Sentosa.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.380
We will build new attractions on Brani,

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.720
just like we have Universal Studios on Sentosa.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.580
And we will also revitalise Sentosa’s beach areas

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:13.700
and expand its nature and heritage trails, to keep its island character.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.640
We will also link up the GSW with all the surrounding green areas,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.000
so that you have a whole connection from West Coast Park to East Coast Park,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.360
and also from the Rail Corridor, all the way down to Sentosa.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:38.660
With a new green heart at the centre, Singapore will be even more of a City in a Garden.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.640
I have already received one special request.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.620
When we discussed these plans at Cabinet, Ng Chee Meng put his hand up,

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:56.060
and said: “NTUC is very grateful to the Government for Downtown East.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:01.280
"How about a Downtown South?”

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.820
[Applause]

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.460
I said, ok, we will do that.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:17.620
We will set aside land for the Labour Movement to build a resort, probably on Pulau Brani.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.880
We will make this gesture.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.540
We will make this gesture, to thank our workers for all their contributions to the nation.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.500
Because Singapore is for all of us.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:46.780
Our city today comprises multiple layers and the imprints of different eras.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:52.520
The Greater Southern Waterfront will add yet more layers to the city.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.380
Over the centuries, people have come to Singapore from different lands.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.840
Bringing with them their identities, cultures and beliefs.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.480
Their hopes and dreams, their passions and aspirations.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:12.860
Slowly, they wove these strands together to become Singaporeans, and to build today’s Singapore.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:19.880
The layout and architecture of our city reflects this richness and complexity.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.340
Faint traces of ancient Singapore survive, even today.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.900
In the 14th century, there were settlements at the mouth of the Singapore River,

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.120
and near Bukit Larangan, known as Fort Canning Hill.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:36.440
Soon after the British arrived in 1819, they made a map of Singapore.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.840
It is a very interesting map. Let me orientate you.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.740
This is the Singapore River, the river mouth.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.280
This is the Padang, in those days it was bigger.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.800
This is Fort Canning Hill.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.080
And along the map, if you look carefully,

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:57.540
you can see a linear feature all the way here,

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.320
up, around Fort Canning Hill,

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.820
and it is marked 'historical lines of Singapore'.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.260
And along this line...

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.040
there is a river to be seen.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:25.020
So these 'historical lines of Singapore' are actually an ancient defensive line.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.840
It's a line of defence.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:31.380
It is an earth wall, dating back hundreds of years.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:43.180
And the river which runs along the earth wall, is today the Stamford Canal.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.780
So the wall itself is gone, but Stamford Road follows the line of that wall.

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:58.060
So today, if you walk along Stamford Road, you are walking along the ancient wall of Singapura.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.640
There is history there.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.320
Parts of our Civic District and Central Business District are still laid out according to the first town plan

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.280
that Raffles and his team drew up, 200 years ago.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.520
Many of the colonial buildings remain, often restored and repurposed,

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.420
so the former Supreme Court and City Hall have become the National Gallery Singapore.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.520
Over 2 centuries, we have built and rebuilt generations of buildings.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.460
Today, we have created a distinctive city skyline,

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.740
and a vibrant waterfront all round Marina Bay.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:44.780
When we first reclaimed Marina Bay, Marina East, Central and South, 40 years ago, they were empty.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.180
A blank slate.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.140
For some years, we left the new land fallow.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.760
Definite plans only came later,

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.840
as we developed a clearer sense of what the city needed,

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.840
and began putting the building blocks in place.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.160
Now a new downtown is taking shape in Marina South,

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.920
anchored around Marina Bay Financial Centre and Marina Bay Sands.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.920
Marina Bay is still far from fully developed.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:22.700
Meanwhile, we are already looking ahead, for our next major move.

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:30.440
Our modern port dates back to Raffles, who recognised Singapore’s qualities as a natural harbour.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:37.340
Nearly 50 years ago, we converted the wharves at Tanjong Pagar into our first container terminal.

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:45.680
In 1991, as Tanjong Pagar reached its limits, we made a major decision:

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:52.660
to reclaim land at Pasir Panjang to build a new container terminal.

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:56.460
At that time, PSA was handling 6 million containers a year –

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:01.380
they call them TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units).

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.700
But PSA had audacious plans:

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:11.680
to build a port to handle 6 times that number, 36 million TEUs.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.940
Siao ah!

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:20.380
Building Pasir Panjang Terminal was a considerable act of faith.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.140
But we backed PSA up, and PSA delivered:

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:29.340
last year, it handled 36 million TEUs and more!

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:36.080
[Applause]

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:44.300
Now we are making yet another leap, building Tuas Port, where PSA can double its volumes.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:50.880
When PSA moves out of the city and Pasir Panjang terminals, these old spaces will once again be vacant.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.240
Another blank slate.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.840
And a  new generation will have another opportunity to imagine and to build here

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.420
some part of their vision for Singapore.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.220
I hope they will remember to place a marker somewhere,

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:08.460
to remind themselves that PSA used to be there,

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.940
and that it was the same daring and ambition,

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:16.120
the same drive for excellence and determination to prevail,

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:25.220
that made PSA a success, and will make the Greater Southern Waterfront a reality.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:33.300
[Applause]

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:37.800
Over the years, I have talked about many major projects at National Day Rallies.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.300
These are all progressively taking shape.

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.600
In 2013, I described Jewel at Changi Airport.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.960
At that time, Jewel was just a concept and an ambition.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:58.140
Now we have completed it, on time and within budget!

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.540
[Applause]

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.440
Kudos to the Changi team!

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:11.880
[Applause]

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.640
Singapore has a spectacular new gateway to the world.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:22.880
Many of you have visited, and we are all rightly very proud of it.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:30.940
What we talk about, this Government, we will deliver.

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:38.520
[Applause]

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:44.020
In the same way, we are realising our other ambitious plans.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.400
Punggol Digital District.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.600
Jurong Lake District.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.420
Changi Terminal 5.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.640
Redevelopment of Paya Lebar Airbase.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.280
Tuas Port.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.340
And of course, the Greater Southern Waterfront.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:04.720
All these will not be done in a decade, or even in one generation.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:11.520
There will be space for successive generations to fill with their hopes and dreams.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:19.240
Each new generation will leave their mark on our city, as their predecessors have done.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.020
This Bicentennial year, as we commemorate our history and progress,

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.140
we also commit ourselves to improve on what we have,

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:30.980
and build a better Singapore for our children.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.680
All this depends on Singaporeans remaining one united people,

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:44.500
and having an honest and capable government working together with you, for you, for Singapore.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:52.720
[Applause]

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.820
The next few years will be very demanding.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:59.500
We have to hand over smoothly to a new generation of leaders,

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.460
and continue to strive to realise our ambitions.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:08.160
My team will work with you to build this jewel of a nation,

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.200
so that Singapore will always be a vibrant, thriving city,
